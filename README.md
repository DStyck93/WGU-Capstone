# WGU-Capstone
This capstone project is a Java application developed using the JavaFX GUI. It uses algorithms designed by me to estimate the effectiveness of NHL players. It also makes predictions on what their statistics will look 
like for the upcoming season. Please keep in mind this is just a demo project. I went above and beyond what was required from WGU. I could have spent another couple months putting in everything I wanted.
